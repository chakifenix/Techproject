[stream-chat-swift](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-chat-swift) is the official iOS SDK for [Stream Chat](https://getstream.io/chat), a service for building chat applications.

You can sign up for a Stream account at [https://getstream.io/chat/get_started/](https://getstream.io/chat/get_started/).

## Requirements

- iOS 11
- Xcode 10.2
- Swift 5
- CocoaPods 1.7+

## Installation

Stream Chat SDK consists of two frameworks: `StreamChat` and `StreamChatCore`

- `StreamChat` — the full SDK library with all UI components. Styling and deep customizations are all supported out of the box.
- `StreamChatCore` — low-level library to use Stream Chat APIs. It includes models, presenters, notification manager and HTTP interface.

### CocoaPods

To integrate StreamChat into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, add this entry in your `Podfile`:

```
pod 'StreamChat'
```

Then run `pod install`.

If you want to use only `StreamChatCore`, you can add this entry in your `Podfile`:

```
pod 'StreamChatCore'
```

In any file you'd like to use Stream Chat in, don't forget to import the frameworks:

```
import StreamChat
```

**or** `StreamChatCore` if you are working with the low-level client:

```
import StreamChatCore
```

### Carthage

To integrate Stream Chat into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```
github "GetStream/stream-chat-swift"
```

Then run: `carthage update --platform iOS --new-resolver`. This will build frameworks: `StreamChatCore.framework` and `StreamChat.framework` into `<Path to your Project>/Carthage/Build/iOS/` from where you can add them to your project and link them with your app target. Follow with these steps:

- Open your Xcode project
- Select the project in the Navigator
- Select your app target
- Open `General` panel
- Click the `+` button in the `Linked Franeworks and Libraries` section
- Click the `Add Other...` and add `StreamChatCore.framework` in `<Path to your Project>/Carthage/Build/iOS/`
- Add `StreamChat.framework` if you need UI components
- Open `Build Phases` panel
- Click the `+` button and select `New Run Script Phase`
- Set the content to: `/usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks`  
- Add to `Input Files`:
  - `$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/StreamChatCore.framework`
  - `$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/StreamChat.framework`
- Add to `Output Files`:
  - `$(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)/$(FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH)/StreamChatCore.framework`
  - `$(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)/$(FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH)/StreamChat.framework`
  
Now build your app.
